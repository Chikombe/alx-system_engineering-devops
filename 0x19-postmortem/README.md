0x19. Postmortem

Overview
0x19. Postmortem is a platform designed to facilitate the documentation and analysis of postmortems in software development teams. In the tech industry, failures are inevitable, stemming from various factors such as bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, and human error. However, failure presents a valuable opportunity for learning and improvement. Any great Software Engineer must learn from their mistakes to ensure they won’t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not acceptable.

A postmortem, also known as an incident report, is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage or incident, the team(s) in charge of the system write a summary with two main goals:

Providing Information: To provide the rest of the company’s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Outages can have a significant impact on a company, so managers and executives need to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
Identifying Solutions: To ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage are discovered and that measures are taken to fix them and prevent recurrence.
